### 🌟 What's New in v0.7.6
- **One-Click Auto-Updater**: Check npm and upgrade directly in the DSH settings card.
- **Composition Services**: Exposes `dshGitea` (task provisioning) and `giteaEvents` (safe telemetry bridge for `@goodandready/dsh-pulse`).
- **Security & Hygiene**: Loopback and origin-hardened HTTP write guards (`lib/http-guard.js`), sanitized GitHub release export pipeline (`publish.sh`).
- **Performance & Caching**: Cache invalidation on git mutations and modularized `lib/tool-defs.js`.

### 🌟 What's New in v0.7.5
- **Canonical English Server & Agent Tool Outputs**: All tool responses, verification details, and error messages conform strictly to `dsh-plugin-authoring` canonical English standard.
- **Clean Package Boundaries**: Standalone issue form templates are safely organized in `assets/issue-templates/`; internal development specs (`docs/superpowers/`, `.gitea/`) are strictly excluded from npm packages.
- **Automated Compliance Quality Gate**: Permanent test coverage enforcing 0 Cyrillic characters across `lib/` and strict package file boundary audits.

## ⚡ Overview & Problem Solved

When autonomous AI coding agents perform complex multi-step development in DeepSeek Harness, they require seamless access to issue trackers, pull request review workflows, branch creation, and isolated workspace worktrees without risking repository corruption or leaking credentials into chat logs.

**`@goodandready/dsh-gitea`** bridges DeepSeek Harness to self-hosted **Gitea** and **Forgejo** instances. It equips agents with a complete suite of 20+ structured tools, registers a live **Git Status Chip** directly in the Web UI chat header, and enforces safety rails (`confirm: true` merge guards and dedicated write wrappers).

### 2. Per-branch PR templates

When creating a PR via issue-flow without an explicit body, the plugin fills a template by branch type: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, `refactor/`.

### 3. Live Git Status Chip & Topological Commit Graph

The client component injects a real-time Git Status Chip into the DSH Web UI chat header:
* **Active Repository & Branch**: Displays current branch name (e.g., `feature/issue-42-auth`).
* **Tree Cleanliness**: Color-coded badges indicating clean vs dirty working trees and modified files count.
* **Ahead/Behind Sync Badges**: Real-time sync indicator (`↑ahead`, `↓behind`) relative to upstream or `origin/<branch>`.
* **Topological Commit Graph Modal**: Monospace branch/merge lane visualization (`●`, `◆`, `│`), commit links to Gitea Web UI, branch and tag badges, and live Gitea Actions CI statuses (`CI ✓`, `CI ✗`, `CI ●`).
* **Cross-Tab Synchronization**: Efficient multi-tab coordination using `navigator.locks` leader election and `BroadcastChannel`, eliminating duplicate network polling.
* **Uncommitted Diff Inspector**: 1-click panel showing recent commits and uncommitted diff.

---

### 3. Worktree Isolation & Agent Safety Rails

To allow autonomous agents to work on multiple issues without touching the primary branch:
* **Non-destructive Worktrees**: Creates worktree paths under `.worktrees/issue-<id>/` or custom directories.
* **Confirm Guard Matrix**: Destructive operations like `gitea_pr_merge` and `gitea_worktree_remove` strictly require explicit boolean `confirm: true`. Unconfirmed tool calls are automatically rejected.
* **Git Wrapper Enforcement**: Write operations can be routed through a dedicated wrapper (`gitWrapper`, e.g., `git-deepseek-harness`) to enforce agent author signatures.

---

### 4. Gitea Issue Templates Pack

Includes standardized Gitea YAML issue templates under `.gitea/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:

| Template File | Purpose | Recommended Starter Labels |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `bug.yaml` | Bug report | `type/bug`, `status/ready` |
| `feature.yaml` | Feature proposal | `type/feature`, `status/ready` |
| `security.yaml` | Security vulnerability | `type/security`, `priority/high`, `scope/security` |
| `research.yaml` | Architectural research / spike | `type/research`, `status/ready` |
| `tech-debt.yaml` | Technical debt & refactoring | `type/tech-debt`, `status/ready` |
| `incident.yaml` | Production incident report | `type/incident`, `priority/critical` |
| `config-change.yaml` | Infrastructure & config change | `type/refactor`, `scope/settings`, `status/ready` |

---

### 5. Gitea Hub, CI RCA & Interactive Worktree Management

- **CI Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: When a Gitea Actions build fails, the Hub PR card shows an **"Explain CI"** button. Clicking it runs deep semantic log parsing: identifying the exact failing step, extracting a sanitized code snippet, classifying the defect (tests, dependency, linter, syntax, build), and generating actionable remediation advice without navigating away from the workspace.
- **Autonomous Agent Worktrees**: Direct review approval, merge, close, and worktree switching buttons directly embedded in the DSH drawer.

The drawer interface includes a dedicated **Gitea Hub** backed by `/dsh-gitea/hub`:
- **Assigned Issues & PRs**: Live overview of assigned work items, status badges, and direct review/merge/close actions.
- **Worktree Management**: Instant switching between active worktree directories and safe cleaning of merged worktrees.
- **Actions Runners Inspection**: Real-time monitoring of available Gitea Actions runners and execution state.

### 6. Autonomous Agent Lifecycle & Safety Rails

- **Automated Worktree GC (`gitea_worktree_gc`)**: Background and on-demand pruning of merged branches using `git merge-base --is-ancestor`, fail-safe protections for default branch, current tree, and dirty uncommitted changes.
- **Automated AI Code Review (`gitea_ai_review`, `gitea_pr_line_comment`)**: Submits formal pull request reviews with inline diff line comments, detects secrets and path traversal hazards, and formats interactive ```suggestion blocks for one-click commit application in Gitea.
- **Issue to PR Flow (`gitea_issue_to_pr`)**: Converts issue tasks into PR branches with structured branch templates.

### 7. Ecosystem Integration & Incident Reporting

- **Task Tracker Kanban Sync (`gitea_task_tracker_sync`)**: Bidirectional synchronization with Task Tracker adhering strictly to `dsh-drives.task-provision.v1`.
- **Memory Brain Sync (`gitea_memory_brain_sync`)**: Long-term indexing of issues, PR solutions, and decisions into Memory Brain.
- **Sanitized Incident Reports (`gitea_incident_report`)**: Creates structured incident tickets with automatic sanitization of private keys (OpenSSH, EC, RSA), tokens, and sensitive headers.

### 8. Release Assistant & Real-Time Event Streaming

- **Release Assistant (`gitea_release_assistant`)**: SemVer increment validation, multi-language changelog generation, test suite verification, and preflight checks.
- **Real-Time SSE Streaming (`/dsh-gitea/sse`)**: Server-Sent Events stream with heartbeat keepalive, auto-reconnect resilience, and multi-tab broadcast deduplication.

## 📦 Installation

Install the published package via DeepSeek Harness CLI:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add @goodandready/dsh-gitea
```

Then reload the Web UI and perform a hard-refresh (`Ctrl+F5` or `Cmd+Shift+R`).

### Installing from a local checkout

The Plugin Manager installs an absolute local path with pnpm's `link:` protocol.
pnpm does not resolve a linked package's own dependencies or peers from the
target directory, so the Loader reports `failed to import` (usually
`Cannot find package '@deepseek-ai/schemastery'`). Run the bootstrap once in the
checkout to link the packages the plugin imports from the running DSH install,
then install the path again:

```bash
cd /path/to/dsh-gitea
node scripts/dev-link-dsh.mjs   # or: npm run dev:link
```

`node_modules/` is gitignored; the script never writes to the DSH installation.
A registry install does not need this step.

> If Plugin Manager reports `spawn pnpm ENOENT`, pnpm is not on the DSH server's
> `PATH`. Point it at the binary in the profile patch:
>
> ```yaml
> - id: plugin-manager
>   name: "@deepseek-ai/dsh-plugin-manager"
>   config:
>     pnpmCommand: /opt/node/bin/pnpm   # wherever pnpm lives
> ```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Open **Settings → Gitea** in the Web UI (on current DSH versions the same form
is also reachable from **Plugins → Gitea bundle → row → Configure**):

```yaml
# config.yaml
dsh-gitea:
  baseUrl: "https://gitea.yourcompany.com"
  tokenEnv: "GITEA_TOKEN"
  gitWrapper: ""
  timeoutMs: 15000
```

### Settings Reference Table

## 🛡️ Route Authentication & Security Model

 exposes HTTP routes for web chip polling, commit visualization, configuration management, and interactive Hub actions. To protect against unauthorized cross-network access, drive-by CSRF, and DNS rebinding:

- **Host Connection Authentication**: All internal HTTP routes (`/dsh-gitea/config`, `/events`, `/git-status`, `/git-graph`, `/sse`, `/release-assistant`, `/hub`) delegate directly to DSH's Host Connection service (`ctx.connection.requestRejection`). External LAN/WAN requests without a valid authenticated DSH session are strictly rejected with HTTP 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden.
- **Fail-Closed Loopback Isolation**: When running in standalone or test environments without the Connection service, endpoints fall back to strict local loopback gating (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`). Unauthenticated non-loopback clients are denied access.
- **Strict Write Verification**: Mutating operations (such as updating Gitea instances or hub actions) require valid same-origin headers and authenticated sessions, preventing unauthorized tampering with `baseUrl` or credential references.
- **Webhook HMAC Authentication**: Inbound webhook events (`/dsh-gitea/webhook`) are cryptographically verified using HMAC-SHA256 signatures against `webhookSecretEnv`.

## 🔒 HTTPS and mixed content

When DSH is served over HTTPS, embedded Gitea pages must also be HTTPS or the
browser blocks them (mixed content). Requirements:

- Configure Gitea behind HTTPS (or a reverse proxy) and set **Instance URL** to
  the HTTPS endpoint — then generated links are already HTTPS.
- If Gitea only answers HTTP while DSH is HTTPS, the Settings card shows a
  warning. Optionally enable **`forceHttpsUrls`** to rewrite `http://` links to
  `https://` in tool results when Gitea sits behind an HTTPS reverse proxy that
  accepts both schemes.
- Never disable the browser's mixed-content protections.

---

## 🛠️ Reliability, Webhooks & Multi-Platform Support

Added in `v0.4.3`:
- **Webhook Delivery**: `gitea_digest_delivery` and push notification dispatchers use fully-formed HTTP POST JSON requests with standard headers, ensuring delivery to Slack, Discord, Telegram, or custom webhook endpoints.
- **Cross-Platform Path Resolution**: Seamless operation across both POSIX (Linux/macOS) and Windows file systems, normalizing path separators and handling drive letters transparently.
- **Accurate Merge Analytics**: `gitea_repo_analytics` accurately detects merged pull requests matching Gitea's REST API `merged: true` specifications.
- **Branch & Path Policy Checking**: `gitea_pr_policy` reliably parses `requiredChecks` rules alongside protected branch paths from YAML configuration files.
- **Autonomous Tool Routing**: Non-repository tools (`gitea_repo_create_org`, `gitea_repo_bootstrap`, `gitea_digest_delivery`) execute cleanly without requiring an active local Git repository origin.

## Public composition service

The server half exposes an optional dshGitea composition service when the host
supports Cordis service providers. Its createIssue({ owner, repo, title, body,
labels, externalRef }) method reuses the configured Gitea URL and credential,
validates repository segments, and returns a normalized issue object with
ok, number, and url. It never starts an agent session.

externalRef is copied into a hidden body marker so cooperating plugins can
trace the issue they requested. Missing configuration and API failures are
returned as structured errors; consumers must fail closed. The canonical
consumer contract for task provisioning is
dsh-drives.task-provision.v1.

### Gitea Events Service (`giteaEvents`)

dsh-gitea exposes a producer-owned `giteaEvents` composition service for telemetry consumers (such as `@goodandready/dsh-pulse`):

```js
const stop = ctx.giteaEvents.subscribe((event) => {
  // event: { id, event, action, at, giteaContext: { owner, repo, issue, pull, project, ref } }
})
```

- **Allowlisted safe metadata**: Only public identifier fields (`id`, `event`, `action`, `at`, `owner`, `repo`, `issue`, `pull`, `ref`) are emitted.
- **Zero secrets**: Tokens, webhook secrets, request headers, raw payloads, and issue/PR comment bodies are never exposed.
- **Fault isolation**: Subscriber errors are completely isolated and never impact the webhook HTTP response or other subscribers.

### Plugin Auto-Updater

The settings card provides a one-click auto-updater powered by `/api/dsh-gitea/update`:
- **Status check**: Checks npm registry for updates without SSH or command-line access.
- **Secure installation**: Accepts write requests only from local loopback origins with `x-dsh-plugin-update: 1`.
- **Safe dependencies**: Honors npm release quarantine rules.
